## Directories

   - bin 	- Scripts for automating dull things. (May be written in other languages)
   - bazaar 	- The thing that unifies the Vendors, also houses essential MySQL info. Maybe caching later!
   - create 	- Process that builds the resources required for the system.
   - destroy	- Process that removes all the resources required for the system.
   - dynamo	- Macros for rendering HTML, uses maps because they're sexy.
   - up		- The web server that does the bulk of the real work. Serves up dynamic and static content. 
   - vendors 	- Libs that wrap up the database tables. They're there to remove the need to query SQL directly on the pages.
